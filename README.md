#Viewing the College Scorecard data

##Main listing page

####The main listing page will look very similar to the 03-congress-locale page, in that it will have a few search categories in which users can type a maximum: post-college debt or cost of attending, and also the minimum earnings by students 10 years out of college. It will also have a link to the data source, and an image about college if I get around to it.

##Details page

####The details page will have a list of colleges and links to their homepages, as well as the relevant information (cost of attending, debt, and earnings) sorted by the magnitude of that number

##Filter options

####I will probably have several checkboxes for the different categories, in which users can select the category for the debt, earnings, or cost of attending (i.e. $20,000-30,000; 30,000-40,000; whatever else makes sense).

##Live data applications

1. I think that the US's food environment atlas ([source](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/go-to-the-atlas.aspx) is really interesting given the fact that it is in the form of an interactive map, which I am a sucker for, and that there are so many options that can be filtered on as granular a scale as county. It is very visual (unlike mine) which is helpful as well.
2. The earnings data form the U.S. census ([source](https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/earnings/index.html) is useful in that it provides ways in which to break down and filter simple data. While not **inspiring**, it is useful in a very basic sense.
3. Also from the U.S. census, the data on poverty rates or income ([source](http://www.census.gov/did/www/saipe/data/interactive/saipe.html?s_appName=saipe&map_yearSelector=2014&map_geoSelector=sa_eusd&s_measures=sa_sd)) is a good combination of the good aspects of the past 2 datasets listed. It is in interactive map format, but doesn't have an overwhelming number of filterable options. Also, it brackets it by age and income; I too am hoping to bracket my data
