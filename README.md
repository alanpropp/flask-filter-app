#Viewing the College Scorecard data

##Main listing page

####The main listing page will have several checkboxes in which you can select the range of public university costs that you can select: smallest, middle, and largest ranges (along with the corresponding costs). It will also have a link to the data source, and a description of how the numbers are calculated based on the dictionary to the data (given that it is not a simple cost of attending.

##Details page

####The details page will have a list of public colleges and the cost of attending, sorted in increasing number

##Filter options

####I will have several checkboxes for the different categories, in which users can select the category for the cost of attending minus average financial aid (i.e. under $5000; $5,000-10,000; and above $10,000).

##Live data applications

1. I think that the US's food environment atlas ([source](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/go-to-the-atlas.aspx)) is really interesting given the fact that it is in the form of an interactive map, which I am a sucker for, and that there are so many options that can be filtered on as granular a scale as county. It is very visual (unlike mine) which is helpful as well.
2. The earnings data form the U.S. census ([source](https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/earnings/index.html)) is useful in that it provides ways in which to break down and filter simple data. While not **inspiring**, it is useful in a very basic sense.
3. Also from the U.S. census, the data on poverty rates or income ([source](http://www.census.gov/did/www/saipe/data/interactive/saipe.html?s_appName=saipe&map_yearSelector=2014&map_geoSelector=sa_eusd&s_measures=sa_sd)) is a good combination of the good aspects of the past 2 datasets listed. It is in interactive map format, but doesn't have an overwhelming number of filterable options. Also, it brackets it by age and income; I too am hoping to bracket my data
