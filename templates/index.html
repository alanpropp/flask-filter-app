  <h3>Find out how much public colleges cost: total cost minus average financial aid</h3>
  {% include 'searchbox.html' %}

  <p>Data comes from <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/">College Scorecard</a></p>

    <h6>Calculated by taking the average annual total cost of attendance including tuition and fees, books and supplies, and living expenses, minus the average grant/scholarship aid. It is calculated for all full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who receive Title IV aid. It is included in the IPEDS Student Financial Aid component. Separate metrics are calculated for public institutions and private institutions. For academic-year institutions, net price represents an average of all programs and includes only undergraduates who first enrolled in the fall term. For non-academic-year institutions (program or continuous enrollment), net price represents the program with the largest enrollment at the institution for the length of the full program, regardless of program length (see LProgram), and it includes undergraduates who first enrolled at any time during the academic year. For public institutions, this metric is limited to undergraduates who pay in-state tuition and receive Title IV aid. For private institutions, it includes all undergraduates who receive Title IV aid. The total cost of attendance depends on whether undergraduates live on campus, off campus (not with family), or off campus (with family).</h6>
